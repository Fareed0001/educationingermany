                                        <p>Germany is an attractive place for work. The economy is stable, working
                                            conditions are good and thanks to the social security system you and your

                                        <h4>You will soon be completing your studies and have not found a suitable job
                                            yet?</h4>
                                        <p>If you want to stay in Germany, you can look for a job matching your studies
                                            after you graduate. To successfully look for a job, you should put together

                                            best way possible to potential employers. You can find out how to write an
                                            application letter and other tips on job research in the Looking for a Job
                                            section. In our job listings you can also directly look for vacancies and
                                            apply.</p>
                                        <p>If you come from a third country, you have the possibility of obtaining a
                                            residence permit (valid for up to 18 months) to look for a job. During these
                                            18 months, you are allowed to take up any type of job. Please note that this
                                            type of residence permit cannot be extended. The following requirements must
                                            be met in order to obtain a residence permit for 18 months:

                                            Proof of successfully completed studies
                                            Proof of health insurance cover
                                            Proof of being able to secure your livelihood
                                            Before submitting your application, check which documents you need to bring
                                            to the competent Foreigners' Authority. Some Foreigners' Authorities also
                                            offer relevant information on the internet.</p>
                                        <h4>You have already found a suitable job?</h4>
                                        <p>If you come from a third country, with a job offer that matches your
                                            qualifications, you can apply either for a residence permit to take up
                                            qualified employment or an EU Blue Card. The following requirements must be
                                            met in order to obtain this residence permit or the EU Blue Card:

                                            Proof of successfully completed studies
                                            Proof of health insurance cover
                                            Proof of being able to secure your livelihood (employment contract)
                                            EU Blue Card: Gross annual salary of at least €58,400 or €45,552 in STEM
                                            professions (as of 2023)
                                            Since the type of residence title you receive is largely determined by your
                                            personal situation, you should seek advice from your Foreigners' Authority
                                            when applying. You can also obtain a residence permit even if you have a
                                            part-time job offer. It is important that the anticipated salary is
                                            sufficient to cover your living expenses. The Foreigners' Authority is the
                                            only decision-making body for this matter.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Note: </strong>If you come from the EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein,
                                            Norway or Iceland, you can live and work in Germany without any
                                            restrictions. You can find out more about this topic in the Information for
                                            EU citizens section.</p>

                                        <h4>Become self-employed</h4>
                                        <p>There are many reasons for becoming self-employed in Germany. If you are
                                            interested, you can get in touch with a start-up advisory service.

                                            If you come from a third country, you will need the appropriate residence
                                            permit, according to your business venture. Read more about this topic in

                                        <h4>Student jobs and internships</h4>
                                        <p>Many students in Germany work in their spare time. Some of them might be
                                            research assistants (wissenschaftliche Hilfskraft – HiWi) in universities,
                                            research institutes or libraries, while others are waiters or babysitters.
                                            Students from abroad can also work in Germany alongside their studies.

                                            Students from EU/EEA countries are allowed to work for up to 20 hours per
                                            week during the semester, just like German students are. There is no limit
                                            to how much they can earn during semester breaks. Anyone from a country
                                            outside the EU can work 120 full days or 240 half-days without the consent
                                            of the Federal Employment Agency (BA). Generally, either an internship or
                                            working as a self-employed person is an option while pursuing academic
                                            studies as an international student. However, it is important to note that
                                            any self-employment activity need consent of the competent Foreigners'
                                            Authority beforehand. Among other things, the Authority will determine
                                            whether the occupation will hinder or delay the student in the pursuit of
                                            their academic goals.

                                            You will find more information on the website of the Deutsches Studentenwerk
                                            and on the Study in Germany website.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Info: </strong>As a foreign student, you need to prove that you have
                                            enough means to support yourself in order to extend your residence title in
                                            Germany. Do you work as a student assistant in a company in Germany while
                                            pursuing your studies? Then you can be your own guarantor. For this, you
                                            need a valid employment contract with a monthly salary of at least 861 euros
                                            (as of 2022). The employment contract does not necessarily have to be
                                            open-ended. However, it must be valid for the entire period of the residence
                                            title.</p>
                                        <h4>Employment as qualified professional</h4>
                                        <p>It is possible to accept an offer of employment as an international qualified
                                            professional during residence for study purposes under certain circumstances
                                            and with the approval of the Federal Employment Agency (BA). This involves
                                            changing to a residence permit for the purpose of obtaining qualified
                                            employment, without having to complete a course of study beforehand (Section

                                        <h4>Vocational training instead of studying</h4>
                                        <p>International students in Germany have the opportunity to switch to a
                                            vocational training programme, if they consider a course of study not
                                            suitable for them and would prefer to pursue a vocational training programme
                                            with more emphasis on practice (Section 16b (4) Residence Act - AufenthG).
                                            The residence permit must be changed accordingly in order to start a
                                            vocational training programme. A residence permit for the purpose of
                                            vocational training requires the approval of the Federal Employment Agency
                                            (BA) and other criteria must also be met. You will find further information
                                            on the requirements of this residence permit in the section Visa for
                                            vocational training.</p>
                                        <p>Before applying, ask the Foreigners' Authority what documents you will need
                                            to submit.</p>

                                        <p>One way of training for your future occupation in Germany is by pursuing a
                                            dual vocational training programme. Such programmes offer plenty of
                                            opportunities for on-the-job training and work experience. Programmes
                                            usually last between two and three and a half years and consist of
                                            theoretical as well as practical elements. You will spend one or two days a
                                            week, or several weeks at once, at vocational school (Berufsschule) where
                                            you will acquire the theoretical knowledge needed in your future occupation.
                                            The rest of the time will be spent at a company, where you get to apply your
                                            newly acquired knowledge in practice, for example by learning to operate
                                            machinery. You will get to know what your company does, learn how it
                                            operates, and find out if you can see yourself working there after
                                            completing your training.</p>
                                        <p>The combination of theory and practice gives you a head start for your job:
                                            by the time you have completed your training, you will not only have the
                                            required technical knowledge, but you will also have hands-on experience in
                                            your job. There are around 325 officially recognised training programmes in
                                            Germany, so there is a good chance that one of them might suit your
                                            interests and talents. You can find out which one that might be by visiting
                                            one of the job and vocational training fairs in many German cities at
                                            different times during the year. Information on when and where the fairs
                                            take place can be found on the Planet Beruf website.</p>
                                        <p>Employment prospects for students who have completed a dual vocational
                                            training programme are excellent. This is one of the reasons why this kind
                                            of training is very popular amongst young Germans: around two thirds of all
                                            students leaving school go on to start vocational. Here you can find further

                                        <h4>Vocational training and pay</h4>
                                        <p>In Germany, students pursuing a vocational training programme receive a
                                            monthly salary from the company they work for. On average a trainee has a
                                            gross income of around €1,028.00. Depending on the occupation and region,
                                            your salary may be higher or lower. For example, during the first year of
                                            the apprenticeship, mechatronics engineering trainees may have a gross
                                            income of up to €1,154.00 per month. The salary you receive as a trainee
                                            increases with each year of training you complete. Part of your salary will
                                            be deducted for social security contributions. If you earn more than €10,908
                                            per year, your income will be subject to income tax. The Federal Institute
                                            for Vocational Education and Training (Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung –
                                            BIBB) has published a report on occupations and the respective salaries you
                                            receive as a trainee.</p>
                                        <h4>Stages of dual vocational training</h4>
                                        <p>Dual training programmes usually start on the 1st of August or the 1st of
                                            September each year. They consist of on-the-job training at a company and
                                            classes at a vocational school (Berufsschule). Classes may include German,
                                            English and Social Studies. Around two thirds of the classes specifically
                                            focus on subjects that are important for your future occupation. During your
                                            training programme, you are entitled to at least 24 business days or four
                                            weeks of annual leave. However, you may only take your leave during school
                                            holidays.

                                            Your teachers, instructors and colleagues will give you all the support you
                                            need during your programme. After the first half of your training programme,
                                            you will take an examination to assess what you have learned at school and
                                            how you have been able to apply this knowledge at your company. You will
                                            also take final exams at the end of your training. As a rule, exams are in
                                            German. If you pass your final exams, you have a good chance of starting a
                                            successful career in Germany.</p>

                                        <h4>School-based training</h4>
                                        <p>School-based vocational training differs from dual training in that you will
                                            spend less time training at a company. You will learn the theory and
                                            practice of your future occupation at a vocational school, called either
                                            Berufsfachschule or Berufskolleg. This will be complemented by extended
                                            periods of on-the-job training at a company or social institution where you
                                            can apply the knowledge you acquired at school. This form of vocational
                                            training is very common in nursing, in the design/creative industry, and in
                                            the fields of business and engineering.</p>
                                        <p>School-based vocational training usually takes one to three years to
                                            complete. It is offered by state and private schools. Private schools often
                                            charge fees. In contrast to dual training programmes, you will not receive a
                                            salary during school-based vocational training. The only exception is
                                            healthcare/nursing where trainees will work in hospitals or nursing homes
                                            for extended periods of on-the-job training. These trainees will receive a
                                            salary for the entire course of their training programme. For example: as a
                                            trainee nurse you will receive a gross salary of €1,191 per month in your
                                            first year, €1,252 in your second year, and €1,353 in your third year.

                                            Further information on the requirements for starting school-based vocational
                                            training in Germany is available in the “Do I qualify for a vocational

                                        <h4>Dual vocational degrees</h4>
                                        <p>A dual vocational degree (ausbildungsintegriertes duales Studium) is a
                                            special form of degree programme. It combines studies at a higher education
                                            institution such as a university or a university of cooperative education
                                            with on-the-job training at a company. This means that you will obtain both
                                            a degree and a recognised professional qualification. This kind of
                                            integrated dual degree course is particularly common in the areas of
                                            business and engineering (e.g. business studies, mechanical engineering or
                                            IT).</p>
                                        <p>In contrast to regular university degree programmes, dual vocational degrees
                                            do not primarily focus on academic studies. In addition to the theory that
                                            is taught at a higher education institution or university of cooperative
                                            education, students also undergo on-the-job training at a company. This
                                            provides them with the necessary work experience that opens up excellent
                                            career opportunities. Moreover, students receive a salary like any other
                                            trainee during the time they work for their company.</p>
                                        <p>Dual vocational degree programmes usually take three to five years to
                                            complete. In most cases, the vocational part is limited to two years to make
                                            sure that there is enough time for the academic part. You can only
                                            participate in this kind of degree course if you have the required entrance
                                            qualification for German universities. The first step is to apply at a
                                            company that will be responsible for your practical training. After that,
                                            you enrol in a degree course at the university your company cooperates with.

                                            A list of dual vocational degree courses including companies that offer
                                            traineeships is available on the “Ausbildung Plus” portal. Please make sure
                                            to apply in good time, as the offered degree courses tend to be very
                                            popular.</p>

                                        <h4>How to apply correctly</h4>
                                        <p>When you have found a vacancy you are interested in, do not hesitate to
                                            apply. At Planet-Beruf.de you will find a step-by-step guide to writing
                                            applications for apprenticeships. The website also tells you how to prepare
                                            for a job interview and what should be included in your employment contract.
                                            Further information on application procedures in Germany is available in our
                                            website's “Applying for a job” section.</p>

                                        <h4>Language courses</h4>
                                        <p>Having a command of the German language will be a major advantage. After all,
                                            the working language at the company where you will train and your vocational
                                            school will be German. Some companies offer German language courses for
                                            young apprentices from abroad or support their efforts to improve their
                                            German skills in some way or another. Thus, when you apply for an
                                            apprenticeship, we suggest you inquire in what way the company will support
                                            you in improving your German. Or you can already learn German in your home
                                            country, for example at a Goethe-Institut. Addresses of Goethe-Instituts can
                                            be found on our interactive world map.

                                            Further information on where else you can learn German can be found in our
                                            Learning German section.</p>

                                        <h4>Your rights and obligations</h4>
                                        <p>Vocational training in Germany is regulated by law. This has many advantages
                                            for you, as the law serves to protect your rights. For example, the company
                                            you work for as part of your dual training programme has to pay you a
                                            monthly remuneration and provide all the equipment that you need for
                                            training, such as tools or safety equipment. The law also stipulates that
                                            the tasks you are given at your company have to contribute to your training,
                                            in other words, your company is obligated to teach the skills and expertise
                                            you require in your occupation.

                                            The law also defines your obligations as an apprentice towards your company.
                                            Your most important obligation is to learn. What does that mean? When you
                                            follow vocational training, you are expected to make an effort to learn your
                                            trade. For example, you have to attend classes at your vocational school on
                                            a regular basis, make sure to call in sick at your company and provide a
                                            doctor’s note when you fall ill.

                                            Are you from a non-EU country and are unable to complete your vocational
                                            training, e.g. due to illness? According to Section 16a (4) of the Residence
                                            Act - AufenthG you will then be given the opportunity to stay in Germany for
                                            another 6 months to find another training position.

                                            Further information on your rights and obligations during vocational
                                            training is can be found on the Federal Employment Agency's website.</p>

                                        <h4>Moving and settling in</h4>
                                        <p>In order to really feel at home in Germany, there are a number of basics to
                                            sort out first. First, you need to find a place to live. Some companies
                                            provide accommodation for apprentices from abroad. Others may help you find
                                            a suitable flat. The best thing to do is to ask your employer for help. If
                                            you would rather look for a flat yourself, you can find some useful tips in
                                            our Housing & Mobility section.

                                            Going out with friends, doing sports or going shopping – Germany offers
                                            plenty of opportunities for leisure activities that you can enjoy with your
                                            friends. Further information on this topic can be found in our Living in
                                            Germany section.</p>

                                            enrolling in a German course. You may have transfer credits that we can
                                            accept and we want to make sure that you are not duplicating previous work.

                                        <h4>STUDY ABROAD STUDENTS</h4>
                                        <p>If you are a student who has studied abroad, it is important that you speak
                                            with the Director of Undergraduate Studies before enrolling in a German
                                            course. When meeting with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, please
                                            bring your study abroad transcript with you which you can obtain from the
                                            Study Abroad Office (or at least a list of courses (and corresponding
                                            syllabi) that you have taken abroad if the transcript has not come in yet).
                                            This is especially important for current majors and minor (or students who
                                            contemplate becoming a German major or minor) to decide which courses taken
                                            abroad can count towards your German major or minor.</p>
