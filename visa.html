                                        <h4>Student jobs and internships</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            Many students in Germany work in their spare time. Some of them might be
                                            research assistants (wissenschaftliche Hilfskraft – HiWi) in universities,
                                            research institutes or libraries, while others are waiters or babysitters.
                                            Students from abroad can also work in Germany alongside their studies.

                                            Students from EU/EEA countries are allowed to work for up to 20 hours per
                                            week during the semester, just like German students are. There is no limit
                                            to how much they can earn during semester breaks. Anyone from a country
                                            outside the EU can work 120 full days or 240 half-days without the consent
                                            of the Federal Employment Agency (BA). Generally, either an internship or
                                            working as a self-employed person is an option while pursuing academic
                                            studies as an international student. However, it is important to note that
                                            any self-employment activity need consent of the competent Foreigners'
                                            Authority beforehand. Among other things, the Authority will determine
                                            whether the occupation will hinder or delay the student in the pursuit of
                                            their academic goals.

                                            You will find more information on the website of the Deutsches Studentenwerk
                                            and on the Study in Germany website.
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>Employment as qualified professional</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            It is possible to accept an offer of employment as an international
                                            qualified professional during residence for study purposes under certain
                                            circumstances and with the approval of the Federal Employment Agency (BA).
                                            This involves changing to a residence permit for the purpose of obtaining
                                            qualified employment, without having to complete a course of study
                                            beforehand (Section 16b (4) Residence Act - AufenthG). You can obtain
                                            further details from the relevant Foreigners' Authority.
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>Vocational training instead of studying</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            International students in Germany have the opportunity to switch to a
                                            vocational training programme, if they consider a course of study not
                                            suitable for them and would prefer to pursue a vocational training programme
                                            with more emphasis on practice (Section 16b (4) Residence Act - AufenthG).
                                            The residence permit must be changed accordingly in order to start a
                                            vocational training programme. A residence permit for the purpose of
                                            vocational training requires the approval of the Federal Employment Agency
                                            (BA) and other criteria must also be met. You will find further information
                                            on the requirements of this residence permit in the section Visa for
                                            vocational training.

                                            Before applying, ask the Foreigners' Authority what documents you will need
                                            to submit.
                                        </p>

                                            company-based training programme in Germany.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            You possess the requisite language skills required for the qualified
                                            vocational training. In general, a minimum level of B1 in accordance with
                                            the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) is required.
                                            This is applicable if the training facility has not yet tested your language
                                            skills, or you have yet to complete a preparatory German language course.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            You must be able to cover your costs of living for the entire duration of
                                            your stay: in general, this means that you must provide evidence of having
                                            at least €903.00 per month (as of 2023) at your disposal. If you plan on
                                            taking part in a school-based training programme, you can provide evidence
                                            of being able to cover your living costs by opening a blocked account or
                                            submitting a declaration of commitment. If you plan on taking part in a
                                            company-based training programme, you will receive a training salary, which
                                            is also considered as evidence. If your training salary is not sufficient,
                                            you are allowed to compensate the difference by showing that you are in
                                            possession of either a blocked account or a declaration of commitment.
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>What opportunities does a visa for vocational training offer?</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            To complete school-based or company-based training, a corresponding
                                            residence permit will be issued for the duration of the training program in
                                            question. Qualified training programs in Germany generally have a duration
                                            of least two years.

                                            With a residence permit to complete a qualified vocational training program,
                                            you are able to take on secondary employment outside your training program
                                            for up to ten hours per week.
                                            If you have successfully completed your vocational training, you can stay in
                                            Germany for up to 12 additional months in order to obtain employment that
                                            corresponds to your vocational training. For this purpose, a residence
                                            permit in accordance with Section 20 (3) no. 3 on the Residence Act -
                                            AufenthG is required. You can apply for this visa at your local Foreigners'
                                            Authority.

                                            To be able to cover your costs of living while searching for a job in
                                            Germany, you are entitled to obtain any form of employment. As soon as you
                                            have found a job for which you are qualified, you can apply for a residence
                                            permit for qualified employment (Section 18a on the Residence Act -
                                            AufenthG) without having to leave Germany. To learn about the other options
                                            available to you after completing vocational training in Germany, see

                                        <p>Citizens of countries which are not member states of the European Union or
                                            the EEA can bring their dependants with them to Germany. Which regulations
                                            apply depends on the nationality of the dependants you want to join you.</p>

                                        <p>Even if you are a third-country national, if your spouse is a citizen of a
                                            member state of the EU or EEA, they are entitled to freedom of movement and
                                            can therefore live and work in Germany without restrictions. All they need
                                            to enter the country is a national identity card.</p>

                                        <h4>If your spouse is a citizen of a non-EU country</h4>
                                        <p>Even if your partner is a national of a non-EU country, you can look forward
                                            to living together in Germany. For your spouse to be able to join you, the
                                            following requirements are to be met:</p>
                                        <p>Right of residence: As an employee, you have a residence permit, a settlement
                                            permit, or an EU Blue Card for Germany.</p>
                                        <p>Accommodation: You have rented or bought accommodation in Germany which is
                                            large enough for your family. You can find tips on finding accommodation in
                                            our section on Living in Germany. </p>
                                        <p>Health insurance and money: You have sufficient health insurance cover and
                                            funds to be able to care for your family.</p>
                                        <p>Legal age: Your spouse is of legal age, i.e. at least 18 years old.</p>
                                        <p>Your family will probably feel most at home in Germany if they all speak a
                                            little German. We explain how this can be achieved in our section on
                                            Learning German.</p>
                                        <p>To apply for a visa for your spouse to join you, you will generally need to
                                            provide your passport and a wedding certificate or proof of a registered or
                                            civil partnership. Ask the local German Embassy what other documents need to
                                            be submitted.

                                            Since processing your application may take some time, we suggest you find
                                            out what documentation is necessary for the application well in advance and
                                            submit your application in good time.

                                            Once your family has arrived in Germany, you must register them at the
                                            Residents' Registration Office (Einwohnermeldeamt). You must apply to the
                                            local immigration authority for a residence permit within three months. To
                                            do so, you must present your passports, birth and marriage certificates, pay
                                            slips or tax statements, proof that you are renting or bought accommodation
                                            and any other documents that may be needed, depending on the specific
                                            situation of your family.

                                            Once right of residence has been granted, your newly arrived spouse is
                                            immediately entitled to take up any kind of employment in Germany.</p>

                                        <p>Learning German is one of the most important steps you can take to prepare
                                            for life in Germany. It will help you settle in more quickly and make it
                                            easier for you to find new friends.
                                            For some purposes, such as work or study, it may even be necessary for you
                                            to demonstrate a certain level of German. Proof of a particular level of
                                            German is also often required when applying for a visa:

                                            Healthcare professions: If you plan to work in the health sector in Germany,
                                            e.g. as a nurse or doctor, knowledge of the German language is essential.
                                            Level B1 or B2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages
                                            (CEFR) is required, depending on the federal state in which you wish to
                                            work.</p>
                                        <p>Note: You will need to obtain recognition in order to practise a regulated
                                            profession in Germany, such as teaching or law. These and many other
                                            regulated professions also require a knowledge of German. Further
                                            information on the recognition procedure and language certificates can be
                                            found on the "Anerkennung in Deutschland" portal, and personal advice can be
                                            obtained from the Service Center for Professional Recognition (ZSBA).</p>
                                        <p>German for students and trainees: If you are applying for a German-language
                                            degree programme in Germany, you will need to prove that you have the
                                            language skills required by the higher education institution. As a rule,
                                            prospective trainees must also be able to speak German at the level required
                                            to start their training in Germany. You can find more information on this in
                                            the “Study” or “Training” section.</p>
                                        <p>German for spouses: German language skills are important to help you
                                            integrate quickly into working life and society. Your partner is also likely
                                            to feel more at home in Germany if all members of your family can speak at
                                            least some German. Nevertheless, if you are applying for a visa for your
                                            spouse or children to join you in Germany, you do not need to provide
                                            evidence of their language skills if you have one of the following residence
                                            permits:
                                            EU Blue Card (Section 18b para. 2(2) of the Residence Act [(AufenthG]))
                                            ICT Card and Mobile ICT Card (Sections 19, 19a AufenthG)
                                            Residence permit for skilled workers (Section 18a AufenthG or Section 18b
                                            para. 1(1) AufenthG)
                                            Settlement permit for highly skilled workers (Section 18c para. 3(3)
                                            AufenthG)
                                            Residence permit for research purposes and mobile researchers (Sections 18d,
                                            18f AufenthG)
                                            Residence permit for other employment purposes; civil servants (Section 19c
                                            AufenthG)
                                            Residence permit for the purpose of self-employment (Section 21 AufenthG)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>German language skills as a visa requirement: A certain level of German may
                                            be required to apply for a visa. You need to have a B2 level of German to
                                            obtain a visa for the purpose of seeking vocational training. German
                                            language skills at level B1 are required to obtain a visa for vocational
                                            training.</p>
                                        <p>A minimum A2 level is usually required to obtain a visa for the recognition
                                            of foreign professional qualifications. </p>

                                        <h4>How is German language proficiency measured?</h4>
                                        <p>Your German skills are usually assessed on the basis of the Common European
                                            Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). The CEFR distinguishes between
                                            six levels of language competence, which describe what learners of a foreign
                                            language are able to express and understand at each level.</p>

                                        <h4>Step 1: Checking the requirements</h4>
                                        <p>You will need to inform yourself about the different requirements for the
                                            various visas to stay in Germany. To learn about the requirements that apply
                                            for your stay in Germany, see Types of Visas.</p>

                                        <h4>Step 2: Making an appointment at the German embassy or consulate</h4>
                                        <p>If you fulfil the requirements for a visa, you must gather all the necessary
                                            documents for your visa application. The list of necessary documents can
                                            generally be found on the website of the German embassy or the German
                                            consulate in your country of residence. Around the same time, you should
                                            also book an appointment to hand in your visa application.</p>

                                        <h4>Step 3: Applying for a visa in your country of residence</h4>
                                        <p>Submit your visa application to your local German Embassy in your country of
                                            residence. Please make sure that you are applying for a visa that
                                            corresponds to the purpose of your stay in Germany. For example, if your
                                            stay in Germany is for work purposes, you are required to obtain a work
                                            visa. This is the only way you can obtain a residence permit in connection
                                            with your visa in Germany.

                                            For your visa application, you will need to select the visa application form
                                            that corresponds to the purpose of your stay.

                                            For all types of visas issued for long-term stays in Germany, an entry visa
                                            fee of € 75.00 will be charged. Generally, you can pay the fee in your local
                                            currency at the German embassy or German consulate in your country of
                                            residence. Please note that this fee cannot be reimbursed if your visa
                                            application is unsuccessful.</p>

                                        <h4>Step 4: Coming to Germany</h4>
                                        <p>Did you receive your visa? Now you can start planning your trip to Germany.
                                            Since you are planning a long-term stay in Germany, you are advised to bring
                                            all your personal documents with you, such as your birth certificate,
                                            documents regarding your post-secondary school or vocational qualifications,
                                            your driver’s licence or your marriage certificate.

                                            Please note that you will have to be within a health insurance scheme that
                                            is valid from your first day in Germany. Proof of insurance will be
                                            requested when picking up your visa from the German embassy at the latest.
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>Step 5: Applying for your residence title</h4>
                                        <p>Were you able to enter the country with your visa? Welcome to Germany! Your
                                            visa generally remains valid for up to 6 months. During this time, you will
                                            have to apply for a residence permit to be able to stay in Germany for a
                                            longer period of time.

                                            Contact your local Foreigners' Authority and inform yourself about the
                                            needed documents to apply for a residence permit. Afterwards you will have
                                            to make an appointment to have a residence permit issued that corresponds to
                                            your visa.</p>

                                        <h4>How to apply correctly</h4>
                                        <p>When you have found a vacancy you are interested in, do not hesitate to
                                            apply. At Planet-Beruf.de you will find a step-by-step guide to writing
                                            applications for apprenticeships. The website also tells you how to prepare
                                            for a job interview and what should be included in your employment contract.
                                            Further information on application procedures in Germany is available in our
                                            website's “Applying for a job” section.</p>

                                        <h4>Language courses</h4>
                                        <p>Having a command of the German language will be a major advantage. After all,
                                            the working language at the company where you will train and your vocational
                                            school will be German. Some companies offer German language courses for
                                            young apprentices from abroad or support their efforts to improve their
                                            German skills in some way or another. Thus, when you apply for an
                                            apprenticeship, we suggest you inquire in what way the company will support
                                            you in improving your German. Or you can already learn German in your home
                                            country, for example at a Goethe-Institut. Addresses of Goethe-Instituts can
                                            be found on our interactive world map.

                                            Further information on where else you can learn German can be found in our
                                            Learning German section.</p>

                                        <h4>Your rights and obligations</h4>
                                        <p>Vocational training in Germany is regulated by law. This has many advantages
                                            for you, as the law serves to protect your rights. For example, the company
                                            you work for as part of your dual training programme has to pay you a
                                            monthly remuneration and provide all the equipment that you need for
                                            training, such as tools or safety equipment. The law also stipulates that
                                            the tasks you are given at your company have to contribute to your training,
                                            in other words, your company is obligated to teach the skills and expertise
                                            you require in your occupation.

                                            The law also defines your obligations as an apprentice towards your company.
                                            Your most important obligation is to learn. What does that mean? When you
                                            follow vocational training, you are expected to make an effort to learn your
                                            trade. For example, you have to attend classes at your vocational school on
                                            a regular basis, make sure to call in sick at your company and provide a
                                            doctor’s note when you fall ill.

                                            Are you from a non-EU country and are unable to complete your vocational
                                            training, e.g. due to illness? According to Section 16a (4) of the Residence
                                            Act - AufenthG you will then be given the opportunity to stay in Germany for
                                            another 6 months to find another training position.

                                            Further information on your rights and obligations during vocational
                                            training is can be found on the Federal Employment Agency's website.</p>

                                        <h4>Moving and settling in</h4>
                                        <p>In order to really feel at home in Germany, there are a number of basics to
                                            sort out first. First, you need to find a place to live. Some companies
                                            provide accommodation for apprentices from abroad. Others may help you find
                                            a suitable flat. The best thing to do is to ask your employer for help. If
                                            you would rather look for a flat yourself, you can find some useful tips in
                                            our Housing & Mobility section.

                                            Going out with friends, doing sports or going shopping – Germany offers
                                            plenty of opportunities for leisure activities that you can enjoy with your
                                            friends. Further information on this topic can be found in our Living in

                                        <p>You may think it’s still early days, but have you thought about what you are
                                            going to do after you have completed your vocational training? Here are some
                                            opportunities you may want
                                            to consider:

                                            Working for a company: Many German companies are currently looking for
                                            qualified professionals. This means that your chances of being offered a job
                                            at your company after you have completed your training are good. If your
                                            company does not offer you a job or if you prefer to gain some new
                                            experience elsewhere, you will find useful tips for job-hunting in the
                                            Working in Germany section. Are you from a non-EU country and have completed
                                            vocational training in Germany? You may be granted a residence permit for a
                                            period of 12 months for the purpose of seeking employment in Germany (in
                                            accordance with Section 20 para. 3 No. 3 of the German Residence Act -
                                            AufenthG). You can search for vacancies in the job listings of this portal.
                                            Continuing education and training: If you feel that you still have potential
                                            to make progress and would like to take on more responsibility, you should
                                            consider continuing with further training in order to obtain additional
                                            qualifications. This will give you the chance to specialise, to advance in
                                            your career or to start your own business. The type of continuing education
                                            and training that is available and most suitable for you depends on the
                                            industry and occupation you work in.
                                            Engineering: If you work in construction or mechanical engineering, you can
                                            pursue further training to become a certified engineer (staatlich geprüfter
                                            Techniker). Full-time training takes at least two years and involves classes
                                            at a higher vocational school (called Fachschule). At the end of your
                                            training, you will take a state examination.
                                            Crafts: If you have trained as a craftsperson, you have the option of
                                            training to become a master craftsperson. This will lead to the German title
                                            of “Meister” which is an officially recognised qualification. Many people
                                            who have completed a continuing training course as a master craftsperson
                                            work in leading positions or set up their own business. Moreover, as a
                                            Meister you will be allowed to take on apprentices yourself.</p>

                                        <p>In addition, you have the opportunity to specialise in specific fields of
                                            your occupation. More detailed information on specialisations in your area
                                            of occupation is available at BERUFENET.
                                            When you pursue continuing training to become a master craftsperson or
                                            certified engineer, for example, you may be entitled to a form of financial
                                            support called Aufstiegs-BAföG. You can find out if you are eligible at
                                            www.aufstiegs-bafoeg.de.

                                            Studying: After completing your vocational training you may also start a
                                            degree course at a higher education institution. For this purpose, you are
                                            usually required to hold a higher education entrance qualification – a
                                            school-leaving certificate that allows you to study at a higher education
                                            institution in your country of origin. However, there are exceptions: the
                                            German Meister qualification also entitles you to study any subject you like
                                            at German universities. If you do not hold the title of Meister, but have
                                            worked in your occupation for several years, you may be allowed to study
                                            certain subjects that are closely related to the vocation you trained for.
                                            The best thing to do is to enquire the specific admission requirements from
                                            the university you want to apply to.</p>
