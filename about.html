                            industry and technology, Germany is a highly developed country with an excellent standard of
                            living and a social market economy widely considered to be one of the most efficient in the
                            world. For two consecutive years, Germany has been ranked the best place to study abroad in
                            Europe and third in the world.</p>
                        <p>Germany is also known the world over for its cultural contributions – you will find

                            which is both old-world and à la mode.</p>

                                            <h4>Study in Germany: Education in Germany</h4>
                                            <p>Germany’s institutions of higher education are internationally accredited
                                                – according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), 6 of
                                                the top 100 and 18 of the top 200 universities in the world are German.
                                                Studying in Germany will place you among some of the oldest and most
                                                established universities in the world, as well as some of the newest and
                                                most innovative.</p>

                                            <h4>Public and Private Universities</h4>
                                            <p>There are 400 public universities in Germany, which are attended by 95%
                                                of the university student population. These institutions are
                                                state-funded, meaning that students do not pay tuition fees (apart from
                                                a small administrative cost at the start of each semester). There are
                                                also around 120 private institutions which do not receive government
                                                funding and are not state regulated, meaning that they set their own
                                                tuition fees.</p>

                                            <h4>The Bologna System</h4>
                                            <p>Higher education in Germany recently converted to the three-tier degree
                                                system of the European Higher Education Area established under the
                                                Bologna System. Rather than the old one-tier ‘long’ programs, Germany
                                                now offers undergraduate courses which result in a Bachelor’s degree,
                                                and postgraduate courses which result in a Master’s or PhD (Doctorate).
                                                This system is designed to be the same throughout Europe, facilitating
                                                international educational mobility and enhancing flexibility.</p>

                                            <h4>Degrees in Germany</h4>
                                            <p><strong>Bachelor’s Degree:</strong> The first higher education
                                                qualification in Germany is a Bachelor's degree. The standard period of
                                                study in a Bachelor's program in Germany is 6 semesters or 3 full
                                                academic years. After graduating with a Bachelor’s degree, students can
                                                start their professional work or apply for a master's degree.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Master’s Degree:</strong>The second higher education
                                                qualification in Germany is the Master's degree. It takes 2 - 4
                                                semesters to complete studies in a German Master's degree program, which
                                                will take about 2 years. Many postgraduate courses in Germany are
                                                offered in English. Germany is one of the countries with the highest
                                                number of universities in the world, and studying in these universities
                                                is almost without the need to pay tuition, and the cost of paying to the
                                                university is less than 200 euros per semester.

                                                They are either ‘consecutive’ or ‘non-consecutive'. Consecutive Master’s
                                                programs build upon an obtained Bachelor’s – they follow on from a
                                                related undergraduate degree and do not ordinarily charge fees.
                                                Non-consecutive programs focus on a more specialized area of study.
                                                These courses may charge fees and are more likely to require
                                                professional or practical experience on top of an undergraduate degree.
                                            </p>
                                            <p><strong>PhD Degree:</strong> The third higher education qualification in
                                                Germany is the PhD degree. There is no standardized period for
                                                completing doctoral studies in Germany, as this is a more in-depth and
                                                individual specialization. The most important requirement for admission
                                                to the doctoral program is the presentation of a master's degree.
                                                Doctoral studies in Germany are free and you do not have to pay tuition.

                                                German universities are internationally accredited and above global
                                                higher education standards in a variety of disciplines. An MBA in
                                                Germany is highly sought after and also a great opportunity for
                                                achieving your business career goals in the future. </p>

                                                a German student visa as soon as you receive the admission letter. It is
                                                important that you do not enter the country on a tourist visa, as this
                                                cannot be converted into a student one, but rather consult the options

                                                you have not yet received an offer from a Germany university, but wish
                                                to enter the country to conduct the application process, attend open
                                                days etc, then this is the visa for you. It grants a stay of three
                                                months with the possibility of extending it to a maximum of six months.
                                                If you are admitted to an institution during this period, you can apply
                                                for a student visa whilst still in the country.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Student visa (Visum zur Stedienbewerbung):</strong> If you have
                                                already been admitted to a German university, then you will need to
                                                apply for a student visa. This is also valid for three months, however
                                                if your duration of study exceeds this time then you can extend the visa
                                                at the Alien Registration Office in Germany.</p>

                                            <h4>How to Apply for a Student Visa in Germany</h4>
                                            <p>You will submit your visa application and conduct your visa interview at
                                                the German embassy in your home country, the address of which you can
                                                find on the website of the German Federal Foreign Office. Once the
                                                application and relevant documentation is submitted, they will be sent
                                                to the Immigration Office of your chosen university for approval and
                                                then returned. This process can take up to 25 days, so it is important
                                                that you leave plenty of time in order to minimize stress.</p>

                                            <h4>Residence Permits in Germany</h4>
                                            <p>Unlike other European countries where the visa entails a residence
                                                permit, Germany requires non-EU students to apply for this separately.
                                                If your application is approved, you will receive a two-year residence
                                                permit. This can be extended for a maximum period of three years to seek
                                                employment (you must apply for this extension before the permit
                                                expires). You will need to obtain a residence permit within the first
                                                three months of arriving in Germany and can do so at your local Alien
                                                Registration Office. The documentation required for a residence permit
                                                includes:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Confirmation of registration from the Resident’s Registration Office
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Confirmation that you have health insurance</li>

                                                <li>You may also be asked to present a certificate of health and/or a
                                                    tenancy agreement, if applicable</li>
                                                <li>There will also be a residence permit fee</li>

                                            <h4>Study in Germany: Housing & Living Costs</h4>
                                            <p>One of the most important factors to consider when studying abroad is
                                                your budget. Housing costs will vary depending on if you choose to stay
                                                in university or private accommodation in Germany. The cost of living in
                                                Germany is quite reasonable compared to other European countries. You
                                                will need around €860 a month to cover your living expenses in Germany
                                                as of 2021.</p>
                                            <p>There are a few options available to students in Germany when it comes to
                                                accommodation, however, the main choice you will have to make is between
                                                student accommodation or renting a private residence. German
                                                universities do not automatically assign students accommodation, so you
                                                will need to do the relevant research to find a place yourself. </p>
                                            <p>Overall, the total cost of living in Germany depends on factors like the
                                                location of where you live and what type of lifestyle you have. In
                                                industrial big cities rent, food and clothes are more expensive. In
                                                contrast, in less-populated areas, you can expect cheaper prices.</p>

                                            <h4>Student Accommodation</h4>
                                            <p>Student halls of residence owned and maintained by Studentenwerk (Student
                                                Services Organization) are present in every university town. This is the
                                                most affordable type of accommodation, averaging around €240 per month.
                                                The 181,000 placements are in high demand, and it is, therefore,
                                                advisable that you apply for this housing as early as possible. This is
                                                done through the website of the Studentenwerk administration local to
                                                your chosen university.</p>

                                            <h4>Types of Student Accommodation</h4>
                                            <p>Numerous types of housing are available from Studentenwerk. The cheapest
                                                and most sociable option would be a room on a floor with a communal
                                                kitchen, bathroom, and living space. You could also opt for
                                                self-contained apartments with between two and seven bedrooms. For a
                                                more private residence, there are single and double apartments available
                                                which are also a little more pricey. Price also fluctuates depending on
                                                the level of furnishing. You can apply for housing with basic
                                                furnishing, typically entailing a bed, desk, wardrobe, and shelving, or
                                                even unfurnished for a cheaper price.</p>

                                            <h4>Private Accommodation</h4>
                                            <p>There is also the opportunity to rent accommodation from a private
                                                landlord or estate agent. Prices fluctuate greatly depending on the
                                                location and quality of the apartment, however, the price of housing in
                                                Germany averages around 210 to 360 EUR per month (although in major
                                                urban centers the price could be higher). To save on costs, consider
                                                living with roommates in a flatshare. Wohngemeinschaft, or WG as the
                                                Germans call it, is very popular among university students.</p>

                                                fully funded by the German government, meaning that neither home nor
                                                international students pay tuition fees. Students need only to pay a fee
                                                of around 60-200 EUR per semester for administration, travel, and food

                                                destination for studying abroad – it is now the world’s third-most
                                                popular destination for international study.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Private universities:</strong> Private institutions do not
                                                receive subsidization from the government and are therefore dependent on
                                                tuition fees. These are not regulated by the government and can cost up
                                                to 20,000 EUR per year. This fluctuates depending on the institution of
                                                study and chosen degree program – engineering or business degrees are
                                                usually higher in cost than social sciences, for instance.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Master’s programs:</strong> Master’s courses in Germany are
                                                either ‘consecutive’, meaning that they follow directly on from a
                                                related Bachelor’s degree, or ‘non-consecutive', meaning that they are
                                                standalone courses in a more specialized area. Consecutive courses are
                                                usually free of charge in Germany for home, EU, and international
                                                students. Non-consecutive Master’s courses can cost up to around 5000
                                                EUR per year for public universities, and up to 30,000 EUR per year for
                                                private universities.</p>
                                            <p><strong>PhD programs:</strong> For the first six semesters of study,
                                                tuition fees do not apply for Doctorate programs at public universities.
                                                However, as with Master’s and Bachelor’s options, PhD students are
                                                required to make a contribution of no more than 300 EUR per semester.

                                            <p>The people, language, and traditions are what makes the German culture
                                                unique, and great for international students. Germany has cold, snowy
                                                winters and hot, bright summers. Spring is extremely beautiful in this
                                                country, with blossom and colorful sunsets</p>
                                            <p>Germany has one of the largest and most stable economies globally. Today,
                                                about 83 million people live in Germany. Germany is a country with
                                                different cultures and festivals which have unique attractions for
                                                students and tourists alike. Germany also has many fascinating
                                                historical buildings and monuments. In culture, German art has played a
                                                significant role in shaping art as we know it today, and it's very
                                                important in Europe. The German people know how to enjoy life and have
                                                fun, so there are fascinating festivals and celebrations in the country
                                                that many people travel to Germany to attend.</p>
                                            <p>You should keep in mind that, in Germany, all shops, supermarkets, and
                                                even pharmacies are closed on Sundays and public holidays. So students
                                                who move to Germany quickly learn to do their grocery shopping in
                                                advance.</p>

                                            <h4>Learning German (Deutsch) in Germany</h4>
                                            <p>Although opportunities to study in English are becoming more widespread,
                                                DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) only has 88 English-taught
                                                programs in its database. There are some courses which are taught in
                                                both languages, usually starting with English and progressing to German.
                                                If you wish to take learning the language into your own hands, there are
                                                many language schools and programs in Germany. The most famous of these
                                                is the Goethe Institution – a cultural association with 159 operational
                                                institutions offering courses in German, as well as about German
                                                culture.</p>

                                            <h4>Why learn German (Deutsch)?</h4>
                                            <p>The German language has around 100 million native speakers and around 80
                                                million non-native speakers. It is the most widely spoken first language
                                                in the EU, and Germany’s prominence in business means that it is the
                                                operational language of much trade in Europe. Furthermore, German is a
                                                language that has shaped European thought in many ways, and so in
                                                immersing yourself in the German-speaking world you will truly be
                                                experiencing the heart of culture in Western and Central Europe.</p>

                                            <p>Germany is becoming an increasingly popular place to study abroad. The
                                                TOEFL® test can be your gateway to Germany. The TOEFL® test is accepted
                                                by more than three-hundred leading schools right across Germany, from
                                                Hamburg to Munich.</p>
                                            <p>Germany isn’t an Anglophone country, but the number of courses taught in
                                                English is increasing every year. English is also widely spoken as a
                                                second language across Germany, making the TOEFL® test your route to
                                                Europe.</p>

                                                of your study program. This is why the TOEFL® test can help students
                                                arrive at university better prepared than their peers. If you’re anxious

                                                process a little simpler. The admission process may be different from
                                                what you’re used to, so make sure you consult the university at which
                                                you are applying if you have specific questions. In the meantime, take
                                                the following steps to get started:</p>
                                            <p>In Germany, you submit your application directly to your chosen school.
                                                Alternatively, international students can use the resource UniAssist.
                                                This is a centralized service managed by the German Academic Exchange
                                                Service (DAAD) which reviews applications before sending them on to
                                                universities. Not all universities use this service, however. It's
                                                important to check this before submitting. The specific admissions
                                                process is determined by individual institutions, however here are some

                                                field of study. Keep in mind that you may be required to take a
                                                proficiency test or extra language lessons. Start by choosing the degree
                                                program that is right for you. Whether you’re an undergraduate or
                                                graduate student, there are degrees in a multitude of fields across
                                                disciplines.</p>

                                            <h4>2. Prepare the Paperwork</h4>
                                            <p>Among the basic paperwork that is commonly required by all universities,
                                                is a letter of motivation, recommendation letter, and a portfolio of
                                                previous work if applicable. Universities will also require proof of
                                                completion of previous studies. To satisfy this requirement, send the
                                                university an official transcript from your secondary school if you’re
                                                beginning a Bachelor’s, or from your previous university if you’re
                                                pursuing a Master’s degree or higher. If you are not a native speaker,
                                                you may also need to successfully pass an English proficiency test, such
                                                as the TOEFL iBT® test.</p>
                                            <p>Some courses also require a level of proficiency in German. Even if you
                                                plan on undertaking your degree in English, some universities require
                                                that you know the basics of German. You can show your German skills by
                                                taking either the Deutsche Sprachprüfung für den Hochschlzugang (‘German
                                                Language Examination for University Entrance’) or the TestDaF (‘Test of
                                                German as a Foreign Language’).</p>

                                            <h4>3. Check Specific Admission Requirements</h4>
                                            <p>Once you find the study program you’re interested in, take a look at the
                                                admission criteria. Before anything else, you will have to meet the
                                                criteria set by the university in order to gain admission to that
                                                particular program. Depending on the university, specific documentation
                                                could be required. Always consult the university website for specific
                                                admission requirements and contact the appropriate university office if
                                                you have any questions.</p>

                                            <h4>4. Submit Your Application</h4>
                                            <p>After you have collected all the required documents it’s time to submit
                                                your application for a degree in Germany. Most applications to
                                                universities in Germany are done through an online application system.
                                                Most German universities use a mutual platform known as UniAssist.de.
                                                Notice that some universities run their own online application platform
                                                and only receive applications being submitted to it. You can gain access
                                                to this information at the university’s website.</p>

                                            <h4>5. Wait to Be Admitted</h4>
                                            <p>Admission results are often notified by e-mail or post. If you are a
                                                fee-paying student, meaning that you are not an EU/EEA citizen, you will
                                                usually be asked to pay the tuition fees for the first semester.
                                                Otherwise, the university where you will pursue your studies will send
                                                you an official letter of admission, admission confirmation for visa
                                                purposes, and other practical information about studying abroad in
                                                Germany.</p>

                                            <h4>6. Get Health Insurance</h4>
                                            <p>Once you have received notice of admission, proof that you have purchased
                                                health insurance is usually a requirement for enrollment. Everyone
                                                living in Germany is obligated to have health insurance, including
                                                foreign students, regardless of their citizenship. If you’re an EU
                                                student, you must contact responsible authorities to see if your EHIC
                                                card covers you in Germany. On the other hand, if you’re a non-EU
                                                student, you must get health insurance regardless.</p>

                                            <h4>7. Apply for a Student Visa</h4>
                                            <p>The final step to a successful application for a master’s degree in
                                                Germany. If you are not from an EU/EEA country, upon acceptance into a
                                                German university, you'll need to begin the visa application process as
                                                soon as possible because the process can take between one and three
                                                months and requires several important documents. Don't wait! You must
                                                apply for a student visa at the German embassy before leaving your home
                                                country. For detailed guidance on how to get your student visa, please
                                                read our article "Student Visa in Germany".</p>

                                            <h4>8. Arrive in Germany</h4>
                                            <p>After you’ve been admitted to a university and have received the
                                                necessary visa, it’s time to begin your adventure in Germany! Think
                                                about the cost of living in Germany and what your budget will be. Once
                                                you have that, you can begin looking for accommodation. Finally, it’s
                                                time to get your flight to Germany sorted and arrive in your new home
                                                city! No matter where you’re staying, there are plenty of sights and
                                                attractions to be enjoyed.</p>
